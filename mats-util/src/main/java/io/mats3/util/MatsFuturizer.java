/**
 * An instance of this class acts as a bridge service between the synchronous world of e.g. a HTTP request, and the
 * asynchronous world of Mats. In a given project, you typically create a single instance of this class upon startup,
 * and employ it for all such scenarios. In short, in a HTTP service handler, you initialize a Mats flow using
 * {@link #futurizeNonessential(String, String, String, Class, Object) singletonFuturizer.futurizeNonessential(...)} (or
 * {@link #futurize(String, String, String, int, TimeUnit, Class, Object, InitiateLambda) futurize(...)} for full
 * configurability), specifying which Mats Endpoint to invoke and the request DTO instance, and then you get a
 * {@link CompletableFuture} in return. This future will complete once the invoked Mats Endpoint replies.
 * <p />
 * It is extremely important to understand that this is NOT how you compose multiple Mats Endpoints together! This is
 * ONLY supposed to be used when you are in a synchronous context (e.g. in a Servlet, or a Spring @RequestMapping), and
 * want to interact with the Mats fabric of services.
 * <p />
 * A question you should ask yourself, is how this works in a multi-node setup? For a Mats flow, it does not matter
 * which node a given stage of a MatsEndpoint is performed, as it is by design totally stateless wrt. the executing
 * node, as all state resides in the message. However, for a synchronous situation as in a HTTP request, it definitely
 * matters that the final reply, the one that should complete the returned future, comes in on the same node that issued
 * the request, as this is where the CompletableFuture instance is, and where the waiting TCP connection is connected!
 * The trick here is that the final reply is specified to come in on a node-specific <i>Topic</i>, i.e. it literally has
 * the node name (default being the hostname) as a part of the MatsEndpoint name, and it is a
 * {@link MatsFactory#subscriptionTerminator(String, Class, Class, ProcessTerminatorLambda) SubscriptionTerminator}.
 * <p />
 * Another aspect to understand, is that while Mats "guarantees" that a submitted initiation will flow through the Mats
 * endpoints, no matter what happens with the processing nodes <i>(unless you employ <i>NonPersistent messaging</i>,
 * which futurizeNonessential(..) does!)</i>, nothing can be guaranteed wrt. the completion of the future: This is
 * stateful processing. The node where the MatsFuturizer initiation is performed can crash right after the message has
 * been put on the Mats fabric, and hence the CompletableFuture vanishes along with everything else on that node. The
 * mats flow is however already in motion, and will be executed - but when the Reply comes in on the node-specific
 * Topic, there is no longer any corresponding CompletableFuture to complete. This is also why you should not compose
 * Mats endpoints using this familiar feeling that a CompletableFuture probably gives you: While a multi-stage
 * MatsEndpoint is asynchronous, resilient and highly available and each stage is transactionally performed, with
 * retries and all the goodness that comes with a message oriented architecture, once you rely on a CompletableFuture,
 * you are in a synchronous world where a power outage or a reboot can stop the processing midway. Thus, the
 * MatsFuturizer should always just be employed out the very outer edge facing the actual client - any other processing
 * should be performed using MatsEndpoints, and composition of MatsEndpoints should be done using multi-stage
 * MatsEndpoints.
 * <p />
 * Note that in the case of pure "GET-style" requests where information is only retrieved and no state in the total
 * system is changed, everything is a bit more relaxed: If a processing fails, the worst thing that happens is a
 * slightly annoyed user. But if this was an "add order" or "move money" instruction from the user, a mid-processing
 * failure is rather bad and could require human intervention to clean up. Thus, the
 * <code>futurizeNonessential(..)</code> method should only be employed for such "GET-style" requests, and any other
 * potentially state changing operations must employ the generic <code>futurize(..)</code> method.

     * The goal of this method is to be able to get hold of e.g. account holdings, order statuses etc, for presentation
     * to a user. The thinking is that if such a flow fails where a message of the call flow disappears, this won't make

     * order, will be lost. Also, speed is of the essence. Therefore, <i>non-persistent</i>. At the same time, to make
     * the user super happy in the ordinary circumstances, all messages in this call flow will be prioritized, and thus
     * skip any queue backlogs that have arose on any of the call flow's endpoints, e.g. due to some massive batch of
     * (background) processes executing at the same time. Therefore, <i>interactive</i>. Notice that with both of these
     * features combined, you get very fast messaging, as non-persistent means that the message will not have to be
     * stored to permanent storage at any point, while interactive means that it will skip any backlogged queues. In
     * addition, the <i>noAudit</i> flag is set, since it is a waste of storage space to archive the actual contents of
     * Request and Reply messages that do not alter the system.
     * <p />
     * Sets the following properties on the sent Mats message:
     * <ul>
     * <li><b>Non-persistent</b>: Since it is not vitally important that this message is not lost, non-persistent
     * messaging can be used. The minuscule chance for this message to disappear is not worth the considerable overhead
     * of store-and-forward multiple times to persistent storage. Also, speed is much more interesting.</li>
     * <li><b>Interactive</b>: Since the Futurizer should only be used as a "synchronous bridge" when a human is
     * actively waiting for the response, the interactive flag is set. <i>(For all other users, you should rather code
     * "proper Mats" with initiations, endpoints and terminators)</i>.</li>
     * <li><b>No audit</b>: Since this message will not change the state of the system (i.e. the "GET-style" requests),
     * using storage on auditing requests and replies is not worthwhile.</li>
     * </ul>
     * This method initiates an <b>{@link MatsInitiate#nonPersistent() non-persistent}</b> (unreliable),
     * <b>{@link MatsInitiate#interactive() interactive}</b> (prioritized), <b>{@link MatsInitiate#noAudit()
     * non-audited}</b> (request and reply DTOs won't be archived) Request-message to the specified endpoint, returning
     * a {@link CompletableFuture} that will be {@link CompletableFuture#complete(Object) completed} when the Reply from
     * the requested endpoint comes back. The internal MatsFuturizer timeout will be set to <b>2 minutes</b>, meaning
     * that if there is no reply forthcoming within that time, the {@link CompletableFuture} will be
     * {@link CompletableFuture#completeExceptionally(Throwable) completed exceptionally} with a
     * {@link MatsFuturizerTimeoutException MatsFuturizerTimeoutException}, and the Promise deleted from the futurizer.
     * 2 minutes is probably too long to wait for any normal interaction with a system, so if you use the
     * {@link CompletableFuture#get(long, TimeUnit) CompletableFuture.get(timeout, TimeUnit)} method of the returned
     * future, you might want to put a lower timeout there - if the answer hasn't come within that time, you'll get a
     * {@link TimeoutException}. If you instead use the non-param variant {@link CompletableFuture#get() get()}, you
     * will get an {@link ExecutionException} when the 2 minutes have passed (that exception's
     * {@link ExecutionException#getCause() cause} will be the {@link MatsFuturizerTimeoutException
     * MatsFuturizerTimeoutException} mentioned above).
