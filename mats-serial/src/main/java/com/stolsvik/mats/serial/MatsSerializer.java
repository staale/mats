/**
 * Defines the operations needed serialize and deserialize {@link MatsTrace}s to and from byte arrays (e.g. UTF-8
 * encoded JSON or XML, or some binary serialization protocol), and STOs and DTOs to and from type Z, where Z can e.g.
 * be byte arrays or Strings. This is separated out from the MATS communication implementation (i.e. JMS or RabbitMQ),
 * as it is a separate aspect, i.e. both the JMS and RabbitMQ implementation can utilize the same serializer.
 * <p>
 * The default implementation in mats-serial-json (<code>MatsSerializer_DefaultJson</code>) employs the Jackson JSON
 * library to serialize to JSON.
 * <p>
 * It is worth pointing out that <i>all</i> the communicating parties needs to be using the same serialization
 * mechanism, as this constitute the "wire-representation" of the protocol that {@link MatsTrace} represents.
 *
 * @param <Z>
 *            The type which STOs and DTOs are serialized into. When employing JSON for the "outer" serialization of
 *            MatsTrace, it does not make that much sense to use a binary (Z=byte[]) "inner" representation of the DTOs
 *            and STOs, because JSON is terrible at serializing byte arrays.
