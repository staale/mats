/**
 * Together with the {@link MatsSerializer}, this interface describes one way to implement a wire-protocol for how Mats
 * communicates. It is up to the implementation of the <code>MatsFactory</code> to implement a protocol of how the Mats
 * API is transferred over the wire. This is one such implementation that can be used, which is employed by the default
 * JMS implementation of Mats.
 * <p>
 * From the outset, there is one format (JSON serialization of the {@link MatsTraceStringImpl} class using Jackson), and
 * one transport (JMS MATS). Notice that the serialization of the actual DTOs and STOs can be handled independently,
 * e.g. use GSON, or protobuf, or whatever can handle serialization to and from the DTOs and STOs being used.
 *
 * @param <Z>
 *            The type which STOs and DTOs are serialized into. When employing JSON for the "outer" serialization of
 *            MatsTrace, it does not make that much sense to use a binary (Z=byte[]) "inner" representation of the DTOs
 *            and STOs, because JSON is terrible at serializing byte arrays.
