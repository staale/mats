/**
 * A class annotated with this repeatable annotation will become a Mats Endpoint, where an instance of the class itself
 * is the State (STO) object for the Endpoint, and each method on the class is a stage of the Endpoint. This annotation
 * is meta-annotated with @{@link Service}, and is thus also a Spring bean. This singleton Spring bean acts as a
 * "template" for the State, and any wired (injected/autowired) fields will be available for the stage-methods, but will
 * not be regarded as part of the State when serialized and sent on the wire. In addition, if a field is of type
 * {@link ProcessContext}, it will be injected by the machinery before a stage-method is invoked.
 * <p />
 * All methods that are annotated with @{@link Stage} is regarded as a stage of the Mats Endpoint. To know the order of
 * the stages, and ordinal must be assigned to the Stage - read its JavaDoc. The initial stage is the method annotated
 * with <code>@Stage(0)</code> (The constant {@link Stage#INITIAL Stage.INITIAL} is conveniently available), and the
 * subsequent stages are the ordered list of these stage-methods. The last stage must have a return type, and no other
 * stage can have a return type (but it is still possible to return early if needed, by using context.reply(..)). Any
 * methods that are not annotated with <code>@Stage</code> is ignored, thus you may structure and divide your code into
 * sub methods as you see fit.
 * <p />
 * Each stage-method can take zero, one, two or many arguments. The machinery looks for a ProcessContext and an incoming
 * DTO argument. Neither ProcessContext nor an incoming DTO is required. The rationale for taking more than the required
 * arguments is that you could potentially want to invoke it differently in a testing scenario (however, that is
 * probably a bit dirty testing style).
 * <ul>
 * <li>0: No ProcessContext nor incoming DTO.</li>
 * <li>1: Either it is a ProcessContext, otherwise it must be the incoming DTO.</li>
 * <li>2: If one is a ProcessContext, the other must be the incoming DTO.</li>
 * <li>3+: One may be the ProcessContext, and the others are searched for the @{@link Dto} annotation, and if one is
 * found, this is the incoming DTO.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p />
 * The logic to determine which fields are state, and which fields are injected, is as follows: When Mats SpringConfig
 * gets the bean, injection is already performed by Spring. Any fields that are non-null is thus assumed to be injected
 * by Spring and not part of the State, <i>unless</i> the field is <i>also</i> non-null when simply instantiated using
 * the current Mats serialization mechanism of creating an "empty State object" (the rationale is that such fields must
 * be default initialized, like e.g. <code>List&lt;Car&gt; cars = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;()</code>). A field of type
 * ProcessContext is not a state field.
 * <p />
 * It is worth noting that the singleton Spring-constructed bean instance is never actually employed outside of being
 * inspected at start up: Its class is inspected to set up the MatsEndpoint and its stages, and the instance is used as
 * a <i>template</i> for the Endpoint's State object.
 * <p />
 * In a multi-MatsFactory setup, you may qualify which MatsFactory this Endpoint should be constructed on - read JavaDoc
 * on @{@link MatsMapping} for how this works.
