         * to find storage for these bytes yourself - an obvious place is the co-transactional database that the stage
         * typically has available. This feature gives the ability to "pause" the current Mats flow, and later restore
         * the execution from where it left off, probably with some new information that have been gathered in the
         * meantime. This can typically relieve the Mats Stage Processing thread from having to wait for another
         * service's execution (whose execution must then be handled by some other thread). This could be a longer
         * running process, or a process whose execution time is variable, maybe residing on a Mats-external service
         * structure: E.g. some REST service that sometimes lags, or sometimes is down in smaller periods. Or a service
         * on a different Message Broker. Once this "Mats external" processing has finished, that thread can invoke
         * {@link MatsInitiate#unstash(byte[], Class, Class, Class, ProcessLambda) unstash(stashBytes,...)} to get the
         * Mats flow going again. Notice that functionally, the unstash-operation is a kind of initiation, only that
         * this type of initiation doesn't start a <i>new</i> Mats flow, rather <i>continuing an existing flow</i>.
         * <p />
         * <b>Notice that this feature should not typically be used to "park" a Mats flow for days.</b> One might have a
         * situation where a part of an order flow potentially needs manual handling, e.g. validating a person's
         * identity if this has not been validated before. It might (should!) be tempting to employ the stash function
         * then: Stash the Mats flow in a database. Make a GUI where the ID-validation can be performed by some
         * employee. When the ID is either accepted or denied, you unstash the Mats flow with the result, getting a very
         * nice continuous mats flow for new orders which is identical whether or not ID validation needs to be
         * performed. However, if this ID-validation process can take days or weeks to execute, it will be a poor
         * candidate for the stash-feature. The reason is that embedded within the execution context which you get a
         * binary serialization of, there might be several serialized <i>state</i> representations of the endpoints
         * laying upstream of this call flow. When you "freeze" these by invoking stash, you have immediately made a
         * potential future deserialization-crash if you change the code of those upstream endpoints (which quite
         * probably resides in different code bases than the one employing the stash feature), specifically changes of
         * the state classes they employ: When you deploy these code changes while having multiple flows frozen in
         * stashes, you will have a problem when they are later unstashed and the Mats flow returns to those endpoints
         * whose state classes won't deserialize back anymore. It is worth noting that you always have these problems
         * when doing deploys where the state classes of Mats endpoints change - it is just that usually, there won't be
         * any, and at least not many, such flows in execution at the precise deploy moment (and also, that changing the
         * state classes are in practice really not that frequent). However, by stashing over days, instead of a normal
         * Mats flow that take seconds, you massively increase the time window in which such deserialization problems
         * can occur. You at least have to consider this if employing the stash-functionality.
         * <p />
         * <b>Note about data and metadata which should be stored along with the stash-bytes:</b> You only get a binary
         * serialized incoming execution context in return from this method (which includes the incoming message,
         * incoming state, the execution stack and {@link ProcessContext#getTraceProperty(String, Class) trace
         * properties}, but not "sideloaded" {@link ProcessContext#getBytes(String) bytes} and
         * {@link ProcessContext#getString(String) strings}). The returned byte array are utterly opaque seen from the
         * Mats API side (however, depending on the serialization mechanism employed in the Mats implementation, you
         * might be able to peek into them anyway - but this should at most be used for debugging/monitoring
         * introspection). Therefore, any information from the incoming message, or from your state object, or anything
         * else from the {@link DetachedProcessContext} which is needed to actually execute the job that should be
         * performed outside of the Mats flow, <u>must be picked out manually</u> before exiting the process lambda.
         * This also goes for "sideloaded" objects ({@link ProcessContext#getBytes(String) bytes} and
         * {@link ProcessContext#getString(String) strings}) - which will not be available inside the unstashed process
         * lambda (they are not a part of the stash-bytes). Also, you should for debugging/monitoring purposes also
         * store at least the Mats flow's {@link ProcessContext#getTraceId() TraceId} and a timestamp along with the
         * stash and data. You should probably also have some kind of monitoring / health checks for stashes that have
         * become stale - i.e. stashes that have not been unstashed for a considerable time, and whose Mats flow have
         * thus stopped up, and where the downstream endpoints/stages therefore will not get invoked.
         * <p />

         * <ul>
         * <li>Invoking {@code stash()} will not affect the stage processing in any way other than producing a
         * serialized representation of the current incoming execution point. You can still send out messages. You could
         * even reply, but then, what would be the point of stashing?</li>
         * <li>Repeated invocations within the same stage will yield (effectively) the same stash, as any processing
         * done inside the stage before invoking {@code stash()} don't affect the <i>incoming</i> execution point.</li>
         * <li>You will have to exit the current process lambda yourself - meaning that this cannot be used in a
         * {@link MatsEndpoint#lastStage(Class, ProcessReturnLambda) lastStage}, as you cannot return from such a stage
         * without actually sending a reply ({@code return null} replies with {@code null}). Instead employ a
         * {@link MatsEndpoint#stage(Class, ProcessLambda) normal stage}, using {@link ProcessContext#reply(Object)} to
         * return a reply if needed.</li>
         * <li>Mats won't care if you unstash() the same stash multiple times, but your downstream parts of the Mats
